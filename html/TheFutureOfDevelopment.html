<h2>Introductiion</h2>
<p>In the future, I won't have a job, AI will be writing all the code in the world, and you will be wishing that you learned about the magic of working exclusiviely in the terminal with amazing tools such as VIM and Lynx. No more pretty pictures and colors, we're going all in on grueling text and at ascii art. Maybe we'll get some syntax highlighting along the way but who needs that when your brain is moving at the rate of your average 100x developer while mashing keyboards like Faker.</p>
<h2>Vim and the brilliance of it</h2>
<p>I wasn't always a believer in VIM. Multiple times over and over I tried to learn how to use it, only to come up short through frustrations. There was even a keyboard game meant to introduce newbies to vim commands. But these methods never really worked for me. What did work was just all in frustration on torment for like a whole week, where I converted my entire setup at both work and at home to utilize only VIM for all coding related tasks. You can imagine that my productivity took a dive. Luckily work was slow for me at the time so it didn't really bother me too much in that sense but the endless frustrations of having to look down at the keyboard and remember what shortcuts split a window or moved to the end of a line was tormenting. Eventually, after a now seemingly short amount of time, I broke through. HJKL felt natural to move around through letters. I realized that WEB all contributed to skipping across words ever so faster. Replacements for page up and downs and start and end lines made a full size keyboard easier to let go of. It was like magic when my brain started putting the pieces together to this magnificent form of control. And to the outside world.... I was the wizard.</p>
